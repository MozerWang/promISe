Which factor s most important in determining the history of volanism and tectonism on a planet?,size of the planet,presence of an atmosphere,distance from the sun,rotation period,A
Why is the sky blue?,Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.,Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.,Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.,Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.,C
The resolution of a telescope is a measure of its:,Ability to magnify distant objects,Ability to measure the angular separation of objects,Ability to measure the distance between objects,Light-collecting efficiency,B

Which statement about an atom is not true:,The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume.,A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons.,A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.,The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels.,C
Which planet(s) in the solar system has/have active plate tectonics?,Mars,Venus,Earth,Mars and Earth,C
Why are Cepheid stars relevant for astronomers?,To measure interstellar mass.,To measure galactic distances.,To measure galactic energy-density.,To measure interstellar density.,B
How do scientists know that the majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt?,The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.,The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.,Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.,High levels of Iridum have been detected in both asteroids and meteorites therefore meteorites come from the asteroid belt.,A

All of the following have been cited as evidence for the Giant Impact Hypothesis except:,The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moon.,Most rocks on the Moon’s surface are older than those on the Earth’s surface.,The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size.,The Moon was once entirely molten.,B
Why did the solar nebula heat up as it collapsed?,Collisions among planetesimals generated friction and heat.,Radiation from other nearby stars that had formed earlier heated the nebula.,The shock wave from a nearby supernova heated the gas.,As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.,D

Why is Saturn almost as big as Jupiter despite its smaller mass?,Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.,Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.,Saturn is further from the Sun thus cooler and therefore less compact.,Saturn's rings make the planet look bigger.,A
