"A state legislature has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state electionswho wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution.

"A rancher owned a 2,000-acre cattle ranch in a remote section of the state. For some time the rancher's cattle had been seized upon by roaming packs of wolves. In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device.

"A retiree, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres.

The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon.

The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president.

In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who f anyone was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed.

"An accountant had an office on the eighth floor of a downtown building. The accountant wanted to have renovations done to the entrance to the office. He hired an interior designer to do the work. The designer told the accountant that he had several options for the type of glass to be used in the door to the office. He could use half-inch thick plate glass, which would look nice and be relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, he could use tempered glass, which would cost twice as much but would be five times stronger than plate glass, more difficult to scratch, and capable of withstanding a blow from a hammer. The designer explained that the great majority of residential and small business establishments use plate glass for such doors. The accountant chose to go with the plate glass. The accountant ordered a plate glass door from a manufacturer and had the designer install the door when it arrived. A few months later, the door shattered when one of the accountant's clients pulled on the handle to open it. The glass cut the client's hand. If the client asserts a claim against the accountant based on negligence and establishes negligent manufacture of the glass door by the manufacturer that was not discoverable through reasonable inspection, the plaintiff will","prevail, because the accountant is liable for its supplier's negligence.","prevail, because the accountant instructed the designer to install plate glass rather than the more durable tempered glass.","not prevail, because the accountant could not reasonably have been expected to discover the defect.","not prevail, because the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant.",C

On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness the following question:""Isn't it true that when you filed your federal income tax return last year, you failed to report the interest income from your savings accounts?"" The prosecuting attorney was informed of this fact by the witness's accountant.

"Recently, Congress enacted a statute requiring all boat owners to register their boats with a newly created federal boat registry. Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?","No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.","No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.","Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.","Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.",C
"A seller listed real property for $500,000, which was set to expire on Aug.1.

On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?","Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where ""time is of the essence"" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.","Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.","No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.","No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.",B

Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother.

The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be","granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.","granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.","denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.","denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.",C
A state government enacted a law that prohibited the state's agencies from purchasing services or goods from and companies doing business with Cuba. The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council.

"A husband and wife had a stormy relationship. The husband, who was an alcoholic, frequently beat his wife when he became drunk. One day, the husband had been drinking beer while watching football on television. After his favorite team lost a close game, the husband went into a violent rage. As he was storming around the apartment, he suddenly grabbed his wife and led her outside to their car. He then ordered her to get inside the vehicle. The husband was driving around aimlessly when he negligently collided with another car. The other driver, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against the husband to recover damages.

The car driver was distracted by his cell phone and received a careless driving ticket from the police. The woman filed a claim for damages, asserting that the car driver was negligent per se. She claimed that a finding of negligence per se prevented the driver from asserting comparative negligence under a state statute. Will the trial court likely grant the woman's motion to preclude the man's attempted comparative negligence defense?","Yes, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law.","Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.","No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.","No, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk.",C

The original owner then attempted to sell the property five years later to another purchaser who did not know of the prior conveyance. The second purchaser performed a title search, checking the public records for deeds and saw that title was in the name of his seller. The search included obtaining a standard tax lien certificate, which showed that someone other than the titled owner had been paying the taxes for the past several years.

"Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage.

The contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, and the homeowner paid the contractor $35,000. The reasonable value of the work was $35,000. Is the contractor likely to succeed in an action challenging the validity of the settlement agreement?","No, because the homeowner honestly disputed the amount he owed the contractor.","No, because the reasonable value of the work was only $35,000.","Yes, because the contractor reasonably relied on the homeowner's contractual promise to pay the full $50,000, and that promise should be enforced to avoid injustice.","Yes, because the homeowner's payment of $35,000 cannot furnish consideration for the contractor's relinquishment of a claim for $50,000.",A
"A person owned property next to a highway. After raking leaves on his property into a large pile, the landowner loaded the leaves into several large metal barrels so that he could burn the leaves. Before starting the fire, the landowner telephoned the local weather bureau to determine which direction the wind would be blowing. Because a highway was located on the southern edge of his property, he was aware that it would be unsafe to burn the leaves if the wind was blowing in that direction. The weather bureau, however, indicated that the wind would be gusting in a northerly direction. Shortly after the landowner set the leaves on fire, the wind current unexpectedly shifted and started gusting in a southerly direction. As a consequence, the smoke and ashes blew over the highway, resulting in poor visibility. Moments later, a motorist was driving his automobile on the highway in a westerly direction. The posted speed limit was 45 m. p. h. , although the driver was traveling about 55 m. p. h. The driver could not see the highway clearly and crashed his vehicle into a median strip. If the driver asserts a claim against the landowner, the most likely result is","the landowner will prevail, because the driver was driving in excess of the speed limit.","the landowner will prevail, if his decision to burn the leaves was reasonable under the circumstances.","the driver will prevail, if the smoke from the burning leaves prevented him from clearly seeing the roadway.","the driver will prevail, because the landowner will be strictly liable for causing the accident.",B

"In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who if anyone was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: ""Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute""?","In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.","In a race notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.","In a race notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.","In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.",A
"On January 31, a supermarket entered into a written contract with a produce company to purchase oranges. The contract contained a provision wherein the supermarket promised to purchase ""as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year. "" The agreement also provided that any modifications must be in writing. On February 1, the produce company shipped the supermarket 70 bushels of oranges, which were accepted and paid for. On March 1, the produce company tendered 80 bushels of oranges, which the supermarket accepted and paid for. On April 1, the produce company delivered 100 bushels of oranges to the supermarket. This shipment was accepted and also was promptly paid for. On April 2, the manager of the supermarket became concerned because a Florida drought had resulted in a sharp increase in the price of oranges. Consequently, the manager consulted the supermarket's attorney, who advised him to demand adequate assurances that the produce company would perform its obligations under the terms of the contract. Heeding the attorney's advice, the manager sent a letter on April 3 to the produce company, expressing his concern and requesting an adequate assurance of due performance for the balance of the contract. This letter was received by the produce company on April 4.

"The state constitution in one state guaranteed the right to marry to same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike. A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?","Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.","Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.","No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.","No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.",A
"A woman owned four beach houses. Each house had star-shaped windows. As the hurricane season was approaching, she hired a carpenter to build storm windows for the star-shaped and deliver them to the four houses. Because of the unique shape of the windows, the carpenter had to do all work by hand. The carpenter and woman signed a contract under which the carpenter promised to build and deliver the storm windows to all four beach houses within 30 days, and the woman promised to pay $8,000 ($2,000 per beach house) within one week of completion of the job.

I am dead broke and cannot complete my obligations under the contract. "" The woman then telephoned the carpenter and told him, ""Unless you fulfill your contractual obligations, I will sue you!""In an action for specific performance to compel the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows, the woman will most likely","succeed, because the carpenter's loss of the inventory would not excuse his duty of performance.","succeed, because the beach houses would suffer severe damage in the event a hurricane struck without the storm windows having been installed.","not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.","not succeed, because the carpenter's loss of inventory would render his performance impossible.",A

The gambler explained that he wanted to place a bet with a sports-betting agency that his beloved team would win the college football championship the next year. The gambler further explained that he had read that the odds of his team winning the football championship next year were listed as 100-1, and he wanted to place a $1,000 bet on his team. The gambler told his friend that he would pay him for his efforts.
