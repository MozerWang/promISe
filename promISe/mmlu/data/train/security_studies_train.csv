"When considering the international system from a realist perspective, which of the following statements concerning the advent of war is true?","War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.","War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.","War is more likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states.",All of these options.,D
In what ways might international measures be employed? Are they a help or a hindrance?,"Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker.","A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents.","Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism. The multi-agency approach would also broaden the scope for potential errors, miscommunication, and intelligence failures.","Multi-partner initiatives to support the reforms necessary for the prevention of terrorism have proved ineffective. Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves.",B
Which of the following statements does not describe 'nations'?,Nations may be made up of different ethnic-identity groups.,Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies.,Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state.,Nations may contain multiple religious identity groups.,C
What might the pragmatic implications of biology be on post-conflict gender security?,"Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their ""protectors"". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations.",Perpetuation of violence against women in post-conflict society has devalued the claim that violence is more prevalent in militarized societies. Women were as protected by men in pre-war society as they were in post-war society.,"Case studies revealed that in certain military families, levels of violence were dependent on the degree of psychological damage inflicted during fighting, however this was variable and dependent on the individual not on gender basis.","Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their ""protectors"" which may actually undermine liberal feminists' case of the ""right to fight"".",A
"To what extent is TNC linked with terrorism, and in what ways?",There is growing evidence of direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organization resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. For most terrorist groups criminal activity has been amongst the most important sources of funds with the diffusion of terrorist networks globally operating in correlation to the diffusion of illicit market activities.,The nexus between terrorist groups and criminal organizations are generally a temporary aberration. Differential long-term strategic goals meant that levels of cooperation were generally tactical temporary alliances that would have little pervasive effects.,"There is increasing evidence over the convergence of terrorism and transnational crime, but there is no consensus about whether this phenomenon is a long-term strategic alliance or episodic ""marriages of convenience"".",All of these options.,C
Which of these statements concerning the study of identity is not applicable to social constructivism?,"Identity defines actors, and tells us who they are, what their preferences and interests are, and how those preferences might inform their actions.",Identity is of fundamental importance to the social constructivist perspective because it is the basest principle in defining behaviour; it is a naturally bestowed quality comprised of certain unalterable behavioural characteristics.,"The identities, interests and behaviour of political agents are socially constructed by shared ideas, collective meaning, and interpretations and assumptions about the world.","Actors form their identity through interaction, which in turn defines the types of relationship formed between these actors.",B
"Threats to IT systems can be classified in many ways; in this chapter three different categories of threat are listed. According to this classification, which of the following would be classified as a 'Failure'?","Security systems were not adequate to protect the system against attack from a hacking group, and sensitive data was lost.",There is a programming error in the software which causes the system to perform badly.,All of these options.,"The IT system has failed due to a random unexpected event, such as a tsunami which destroys key electronic equipment.",B
"In what ways is the case for humanitarian intervention, as outlined in this chapter, limited?",It is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights.,Advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights.,Any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states.,All of these options.,D
In what ways has the concept of environmental security been contested?,"Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.",Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.,"The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.","The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.",A
In what ways have feminist and critical security investigations of the 1980s and 1990s expanded our understanding of gender security issues?,Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.,"Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.","Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.","The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.",C
Which approach or perspective dominates post-Cold War Security Studies?,An examination of the social processes by which groups of people construct something as a threat.,"A agenda for peace; peacekeeping, peace-making and conflict prevention as priorities for avoiding military confrontations.",The re-addressing of past practice as a possible cause of insecurity.,"The strategy for state security that is preoccupied with creating and maintaining a distribution of power in the system, beneficial in terms of maintaining security and stability.",C
"For post-structuralists, which of the following is the most important impact of security studies?",Security studies contributes to the literature and builds greater theoretical understanding of the subject.,Security studies records the history of modern warfare.,Security studies teaches a new generation about the reality of warfare and strategy.,"Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others.",D
What is the relationship between HM and realism?,Both HM and realism are based on the notion that there exist within society certain discernable realities.,"HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus.","Whilst HM recognises the importance of the state as an actor within the international system, it also purports that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite.",All of the above,D
How might the diversity of the current global international system impact upon the case for humanitarian intervention?,"The global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity.","Despite the inclusion of a diverse range of political actors, whose cultural, ethical and religious values are often at odds with one another, there exists a general consensus amongst all states that humanitarian intervention is sometimes justified.","The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.","Within the contemporary global arena there are a number of radically different views on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity, there exists a need for unifying principles of humanitarian intervention.",C
"In terms of cyber-security, what is meant by 'resilience' and why is it important?",Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.,The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.,Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.,Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.,D
In what ways is gender applicable to the field of Security Studies?,Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs.,Biological differences between men and women determine their suitability for different roles in protecting the state or referent object.,Gender is not applicable to Security Studies - to create a 'gender neutral' security arena we should disregard gender issues.,"Social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' determine the roles in which men and women are expected to act, by considering these artificial roles we can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.",D
Which of the following security sectors are intrinsically linked with energy security?,Economic and development security.,Regime and international security.,Environmental and human security.,All of these options.,D
What is the 'security dilemma' that faces weak states?,The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.,"The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.","The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.","Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.",A
How does Buzan's concept of 'societal security' mark a departure from traditional understandings of security?,"Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.","The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.","Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.",Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.,B
What has been the importance of the new critical schools of security studies for the development of security studies? Have they simply become IR and lost their position that defines them as security studies?,The next generation is likely to develop their arguments in engagements with policy questions and in direct interaction with policymakers and think tanks.,"Policy knowledge reflected in terms of theories, when an interaction emerges between the US and European thinkers, the theoretical context will be the same.",The set up continues to be one in which security studies is located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners.,"European security studies will be treated as a form of (policy) knowledge, whereas security theory in the US will treat this as the main empirical source for critical analysis.",C
What is the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the global defence trade?,Non-governmental organisations are the primary actors in modern arms control measures.,Non-governmental agencies are unable to access the resources and information needed to develop effective policy or action on arms control.,Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years.,There is a serious lack of involvement by non-governmental actors in controlling the global defence trade.,C
Which of these statements is commonly regarded as a tangible benefit of the securitization process?,Securitizing injects urgency into an issue and leads to a sustained mobilization of political support and deployment of resources.,Securitization encourages more efficient handling of complex problems.,Securitization mobilizes popular support for policies in specific areas by calling them security relevant and encourages the allocation of more resources.,All of these options.,D
Which of these best describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity?,The inherent promotion of feminine characteristics in society.,Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.,All of these options.,The acknowledgement that gender identity exists in many forms and is not binary.,B
When may an issue fail to become securitized?,When the general public is not convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat.,"When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented.",When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measure.,When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.,C
Which of the following is an important outcome of the 'energy security nexus'?,Attempts to exert control over energy reserves in the South have consequences for the sustainability of cooperation between core powers; the emergence of geopolitical rivalries over this form of control has implications for international security.,All of these options.,"United by common insecurities concerning the production and supply of energy resources, international actors are forced into negotiation and cooperation between states increases.","By virtue of their energy resources to which the global 'North' desires access, states in the 'South' gain power in the international arena and have redressed the global North-South divide and associated inequalities.",A
Which of the following is not a purportedly beneficial outcome of the globalization process?,"The redistribution of wealth, addressing disparities in economic and resource allocation across the globe through a sense of greater 'interconnectedness'.","The growing sense of global community, resulting in super-national identities that result from populations feeling closer to one another.","The sharing of ideas, technologies and resources that can directly benefit human security, such as medical advancements.","A global market that has demonstrated the ability, if left unchecked, to reduce poverty and make substantial economic gains.",A
Which of the following statements is not applicable to the Securitization process?,Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor.,"Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act.",The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.,"Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite.",C
What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?,"There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.","Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.","Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.","Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status.",C
What is the relationship between culture and social constructivism?,All of the below.,"Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed.","Social constructivism does not regard culture as being an important feature to study, instead focusing on individualistic aspects of identity such as personal interests and ambition.",Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity.,D
Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?,"Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.","Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.",The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.,All of these options.,B
Which of the following might be considered part of the 'deepening and broadening' of security?,The nexus between identity and security.,"War, the military, and the sovereign state.",Environmental changes.,All of these options.,D
What impact did the end of the Cold War have on warlord politics?,"Within the context of state collapse, elites deliberately engender disorder for the pursuit of commercial activities and the exploitation of neo-liberal globalized shadow markets which would not otherwise be permissible in normal conditions. Warlord politics represented a new form of regime security forced upon weak state elites.",Warlord politics represented the entrenchment of traditional patterns of redistributive networks within society but maintained by alternative political sources. Assistance derived from superpowers was superseded by US hegemonic endorsement at the end of the Cold War.,"Warlord politics in response to the rapid global changes inaugurated by the end of the Cold War and by globalization, was a temporary aberration in the normal function of the state and was reflective of the immediate need to secure infrastructural survival.","Warlord politics was a new phenomenon which represented the opportunistic exploitation of hollowed out state institutions and fragmented armed forces. Commercial activities accumulated in a shadow economy facilitated by the end of the Cold War, not of strategic design.",A
What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?,"From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.",The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.,The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.,Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.,C
What internal security policy options are available to elites?,"Elites create negative inducements for non support of the regime. Redistribution as a means of denial to the power structure in the form of ""elite disenfranchisement"" which may include diversion of resources, disarmament and denial of access to commercial activity routes.","Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime requiring the deliberate undermining of armed forces.",Elites attempt to foster a new politics of identity in which ethnic consciousness is superseded by ideologies orientated around the myth of the regime.,Weak states have cultivated international sponsorship and have initiated processes of democratic reform so as to gain popular legitimacy internally whilst bolstering its international legitimacy externally.,B
How can extraordinary measures be defined as 'special' or 'extra' ordinary?,Where the state employs the use of force or violence this can be regarded as an extraordinary measure.,Those measures taken as a response to a securitized existential threat can be defined as extraordinary.,Those measures that exist outside the usual paradigm of the political realm.,All of these options.,C
"Which of the following best describes what is meant by security in the contemporary world, according to the field of Security Studies?","'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.","'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.","'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.",None of the above,D
