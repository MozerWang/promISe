"Suppose sharing of tiles in a multilevel directory structure is achieved with directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about a shared file. Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?","If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.","If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.","If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.","If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.",C
"Bob writes down a number between 1 and 1,000. Mary must identify that number by asking ""yes/no"" questions of Bob. Mary knows that Bob always tells the truth. If Mary uses an optimal strategy, then she will determine the answer at the end of exactly how many questions in the worst case?","1,000",999,500,10,D
