{"passage": "When I was a child, I often dreamed of the time when I could leave home and escape to the city. We lived on a farm, in the winter especially, we wear quite out off from the outside world. As soon as I left school, I packed my bags and moved to the capital. However, I soon discovered that my life has its too.     One big disadvantage is money. It costs so much to go out, not to mention basics like food and housing. Another disadvantage is pollution. I suffer from asthma(哮喘), and the air is so that I am afraid to go outside. Then there is the problem of traveling round. Although I have a car, I seldom use it became of the traffic jams. One choice is to go by bicycle, but that can be quite dangerous.     Of course there are advantages. First, there is so much to do in the city, whatever you tastes in culture or entertainment(娱乐活动). Besides, there are wonderful jobs and greater chances of moving to a more important job or position. Finally, if you like shopping, the variety of goods is very surprising --- and , what is more, shops are often only a short walk away.     Is life better then, in the city?

{"passage": "Imagination and fantasy can play an important role in achieving the things we fear. Children know this very well. Fred Epstein, in his book I Make It to Five, tells a story he heard from one of his friends about Tom, a four-year-old boy with a cancer in his back bone. He came through several operations and a lot of pain by mastering his imagination.Tom loved to pretend, and he particularly loved to play superheroes. Dr. Epstein explained that it was actually a brilliant way for his young mind to handle the terrifying and painful life he led.The day before his third trip to the operating room, Tom was terribly afraid. “ Maybe I could go as Superman,” he whispered to his mom. Hearing this, the mother hesitated for while. She has avoided buying the expensive costume(戏装), but finally she agreed.The next day Tom appeared as the powerful Superman, showing off through the hospital halls and coolly waving his hand to the people greeting him along the way. And Tom, with the strength of his fantasy, successfully made it through the operation.The power of imagination need not be reserved for children only. We all have the power to use our fantasies to attempt things we never thought possible, to go through those things that seem impossible, and to achieve what we never believed we could. Just as Dr. Epstein puts it, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”It doesn’t mean that you should dress as a superhero for your next job interview. But, next time you are tested in a way that seems impossible, imagine what it would take to overcome it. Become the person you need to become to win over your challenge and do it in your mind first. So, let your imagination run wild, and dare to dream.", "question": "In the last paragraph, you are advised________.", "options": ["(A)to go through some difficult tests   ", "(B)to wake up from your wild dreams    ", "(C)to become a powerful person in your mind     ", "(D)to wear expensive clothes for job interviews"], "label": "C", "answer": null, "other": {"source": "2013年广东高考英语试卷"}}
{"passage": "Returning to a book you’ve read many times can feel like drinks with an old friend. There’s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don’t change, people do. And that’s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.The beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It’s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it’s all about the present. It’s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.There are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway’s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it’s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (令人陶醉的)，an aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (随笔) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar’s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.While I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them. But I imagine that, while money is indeed wonderful and necessary, rereading an author’s work is the highest currency a reader can pay them. The best books are the ones that open further as time passes.

{"passage": "Not so long ago，most people didn't know who Shelly Ann Francis Pryce was going to become．She was just an average high school athlete．There was every indication that she was just another American teenager without much of a future．However，one person wants to change this．Stephen Francis observed then eighteen﹣year﹣old Shelly Ann as a track meet and was convinced that he had seen the beginning of true greatness．Her time were not exactly impressive，but even so，he seemed there was something trying to get out，something the other coaches had overlooked when they had assessed her and found her lacking．He decided to offer Shelly Ann a place in his very strict training seasons．Their cooperation quickly produced results，and a few year later at Jamaica's Olympic games in early 2008，Shelly Ann，who at that time only ranked number 70 in the world，beat Jamaica's unchallenged queen of the sprint（短跑）．\"Where did she come from？\"asked an astonished sprinting world，before concluding that she must be one of those one﹣hit wonders that spring up from time to time，only to disappear again without signs．But Shelly Ann was to prove that she was anything but a one﹣hit wonder．At the Beijing Olympic she swept away any doubts about her ability to perform consistently by becoming the first Jamaican woman ever to win the 100 meters Olympic gold．She did it again one year on at the World Championship in Briton，becoming world champion with a time of 10.73﹣﹣﹣the fourth record ever．Shelly﹣Ann is a little woman with a big smile．She has a mental toughness that did not come about by chance．Her journey to becoming the fastest woman on earth has been anything but smooth and effortless．She grew up in one of Jamaica's toughest inner﹣city communities known as Waterhouse，where she lived in a one﹣room apartment，sleeping four in a bed with her mother and two brothers．Waterhouse，one  of the poorest communities in Jamaica，is a really violent and overpopulated place．Several of Shelly﹣Ann's friends and family were caught up in the killings； one of her cousins was shot dead only a few streets away from where she lived．Sometimes her family didn't have enough to eat．She ran at the school championships barefooted because she couldn't afford shoes．Her mother Maxime，one of a family of fourteen，had been an athlete herself as a young girl but，like so many other girls in Waterhouse，had to stop after she had her first baby．Maxime's early entry in to the adult world with its responsibilities gave her the determination to ensure that her kids would not end up in Waterhouse's roundabout of poverty．One of the first things Maxime used to do with Shelly﹣Ann was taking her to the track，and she was ready to sacrifice everything．It didn't take long for Shelly﹣Ann to realize that sports could be her way out of Waterhouse．On a summer evening in Beijing in 2008，all those long，hard hours of work and commitment finally bore fruit．The barefoot kid who just a few years previously had been living in poverty，surrounded by criminals and violence，had written a new chapter in the history of sports．But Shelly﹣Ann's victory was far greater than that．The night she won Olympic gold in Beijing，the routine murders in Waterhouse and the drug wars in the neighbouring streets stopped．The dark cloud above one of the world's toughest criminal neighbourhoods simply disappeared for a few days．\"I have so much fire burning for my country，\"Shelly said．She plans to start a foundation for homeless children and wants to build a community centre in Waterhouse．She hopes to inspire the Jamaicans to lay down their weapons．She intends to fight to make it a woman's as well as a man's world．As Muhammad Al i puts it，\"Champions aren't made in gyms．Champions are made from something they have deep inside them．A desire，a dream，a vision．\"One of the things Shelly﹣Ann can be proud of is her understanding of this truth．", "question": "68．What can we infer from Shelly﹣Ann's statement underlined in Paragraph 5？", "options": ["(A)She was highly rewarded for her efforts．", "(B)She was eager to do more for her country．", "(C)She became an athletic star in her country．", "(D)She was the envy of the whole community．"], "label": "B", "answer": null, "other": {"source": "2016年江苏省高考英语试卷"}}

To support these worthy causes, Ashoka provides money for the world's most  promising \"changemakers\" seeking to solve (解决) urgent problems and would like to create a  world in which every citizen is a changemaker.Drayton believes that anyone can become an agent for change. The important thing is to simply give yourself permission. If you see a problem that you care about, you can help solve it. The young in particular are willing to accept this concept because at heart every child wants to grow into a happy, healthy,  contributing adult. In fact It is many young people's ambition to set up programmes or businesses that improve social conditions. An excellent example is an Ashoka project started in 1995 in Dhaka, which handled the rubbish problem facing the city ,helped local farmers and provided an income for poor people there .When Masqsood and Iftekhar began to study the problem of all the uncollected rubbish that lay in Dhaka’s streets,Attracting tats and disease , they discovered that 80% of it was natural waste . So they educated the poor people in the city to compost (把……制成堆粪)this waste . They kmew that they would have a market for the end product because local farmers were struggling with chemical ferntilisers (化肥) which were expensive and had reduced the natural minerals in the soil over the years . At first , they were refused ,but once they were able to persuade them that there was money to be made , the project took off.

{"passage": "As Internet users become more dependent on the Internet to store information, are people remember less? If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how.In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood that the computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it.In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder (文件夹). Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location (位置) better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called \"transactive memory (交互记忆)\"According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date.

{"passage": "Not so long ago，most people didn't know who Shelly Ann Francis Pryce was going to become．She was just an average high school athlete．There was every indication that she was just another American teenager without much of a future．However，one person wants to change this．Stephen Francis observed then eighteen﹣year﹣old Shelly Ann as a track meet and was convinced that he had seen the beginning of true greatness．Her time were not exactly impressive，but even so，he seemed there was something trying to get out，something the other coaches had overlooked when they had assessed her and found her lacking．He decided to offer Shelly Ann a place in his very strict training seasons．Their cooperation quickly produced results，and a few year later at Jamaica's Olympic games in early 2008，Shelly Ann，who at that time only ranked number 70 in the world，beat Jamaica's unchallenged queen of the sprint（短跑）．\"Where did she come from？\"asked an astonished sprinting world，before concluding that she must be one of those one﹣hit wonders that spring up from time to time，only to disappear again without signs．But Shelly Ann was to prove that she was anything but a one﹣hit wonder．At the Beijing Olympic she swept away any doubts about her ability to perform consistently by becoming the first Jamaican woman ever to win the 100 meters Olympic gold．She did it again one year on at the World Championship in Briton，becoming world champion with a time of 10.73﹣﹣﹣the fourth record ever．Shelly﹣Ann is a little woman with a big smile．She has a mental toughness that did not come about by chance．Her journey to becoming the fastest woman on earth has been anything but smooth and effortless．She grew up in one of Jamaica's toughest inner﹣city communities known as Waterhouse，where she lived in a one﹣room apartment，sleeping four in a bed with her mother and two brothers．Waterhouse，one  of the poorest communities in Jamaica，is a really violent and overpopulated place．Several of Shelly﹣Ann's friends and family were caught up in the killings； one of her cousins was shot dead only a few streets away from where she lived．Sometimes her family didn't have enough to eat．She ran at the school championships barefooted because she couldn't afford shoes．Her mother Maxime，one of a family of fourteen，had been an athlete herself as a young girl but，like so many other girls in Waterhouse，had to stop after she had her first baby．Maxime's early entry in to the adult world with its responsibilities gave her the determination to ensure that her kids would not end up in Waterhouse's roundabout of poverty．One of the first things Maxime used to do with Shelly﹣Ann was taking her to the track，and she was ready to sacrifice everything．It didn't take long for Shelly﹣Ann to realize that sports could be her way out of Waterhouse．On a summer evening in Beijing in 2008，all those long，hard hours of work and commitment finally bore fruit．The barefoot kid who just a few years previously had been living in poverty，surrounded by criminals and violence，had written a new chapter in the history of sports．But Shelly﹣Ann's victory was far greater than that．The night she won Olympic gold in Beijing，the routine murders in Waterhouse and the drug wars in the neighbouring streets stopped．The dark cloud above one of the world's toughest criminal neighbourhoods simply disappeared for a few days．\"I have so much fire burning for my country，\"Shelly said．She plans to start a foundation for homeless children and wants to build a community centre in Waterhouse．She hopes to inspire the Jamaicans to lay down their weapons．She intends to fight to make it a woman's as well as a man's world．As Muhammad Al i puts it，\"Champions aren't made in gyms．Champions are made from something they have deep inside them．A desire，a dream，a vision．\"One of the things Shelly﹣Ann can be proud of is her understanding of this truth．", "question": "66．What did the sprinting world think of Shelly﹣Ann before the 2008 Olympic Games？", "options": ["(A)She would become a promising star．", "(B)She badly needed to set higher goals．", "(C)Her sprinting career would not last long．", "(D)Her talent for sprinting was known to all．"], "label": "C", "answer": null, "other": {"source": "2016年江苏省高考英语试卷"}}
{"passage": "The Intelligent Transport team at Newcastle University have turned an electric car into a mobile laboratory named “DriveLAB” in order to understand the challenges faced by older drivers and to discover where the key stress points are.Research shows that giving up driving is one of the key reasons for a fall in health and well-being among older people, leading to them becoming more isolated(隔绝) and inactive.Led by Professor Phil Blythe, the Newcastle team are developing in-vehicle technologies for older drivers which they hope could help them to continue driving into later life.These include custom-made navigation(导航) tools, night vision systems and intelligent speed adaptations. Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”“But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”Dr. Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains: “The DriveLAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.”“For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.”“We hope that our work will help with technological solutions(解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”", "question": "What is the purpose of the DriveLAB?", "options": ["(A)To explore new means of transport.", "(B)To design new types of cars.", "(C)To find out older driver’s problems.", "(D)To teach people traffic rules."], "label": "C", "answer": null, "other": {"source": "2017年英语高考试题全国卷3()"}}
{"passage": "The need to feed a growing population is putting much pressure on the world’s supply of water. With 97% of the world’s water too salty to be drunk or used in agriculture, the worldwide supply of water needs careful management, especially in agriculture. Although the idea of a water shortage(短缺) seems strange to someone fortunate enough to live in a high rainfall country, many of the world’s agricultural industries experience constant water shortages .Although dams can be built to store water for agricultural use in dry areas and dry seasons, the costs of water redistribution(重新分配) are very high. Not only is there the cost of the engineering itself, but there is also an environmental cost to be considered. Where valleys(山谷) are flooded to create dams, houses are lost and wildlife homes destroyed. Besides, water may flow easily through pipes to fields, but it cannot be transported from one side of the world to the other. Each country must therefore rely on the management of its own water to supply its farming requirements.This is particularly troubling for countries with agricultural industries in areas dependent on irrigation(灌溉). In Texas, farmers’ overuse of irrigation water has resulted in a 25% reduction of the water stores. In the Central Valley area of southwestern USA, a huge water engineering project provided water for farming in dry valleys, but much of the water use has been poorly managed.Saudi Arabia’s attempts to grow wheat in desert areas have seen the pumping of huge quantities of irrigation water from underground reserves. Because there is no rainfall in these areas, such reserves can only decrease, and it is believed that fifty years of pumping will see them run dry.", "question": "The text is mainly about ­        .", "options": ["(A)water supply and increasing population", "(B)water use management and agriculture  ", "(C)water redistribution and wildlife protection", "(D)water shortages and environmental protection"], "label": "B", "answer": null, "other": {"source": "2010年安徽省高考英语卷"}}

{"passage": "I was in the middle of the Amazon (亚马逊) with my wife, who was there as a medical researcher. We flew on a small plane to a faraway village. We did not speak the local language, did not know the customs, and more often than not, did not entirely recognize the food. We could not have felt more foreign.We were raised on books and computers, highways and cell phones, but now we were living in a village without running water or electricity It was easy for us to go to sleep at the end of the day feeling a little misunderstood.Then one perfect Amazonian evening, with monkeys calling from beyond the village green, we played soccer. I am not good at soccer, but that evening it was wonderful. Everyone knew the rules. We all spoke the same language of passes and shots. We understood one another perfectly. As darkness came over the field and the match ended, the goal keeper, Juan, walked over to me and said in a matter-of-fact way, “In your home, do you have a moon too?” I was surprised.After I explained to Juan that yes, we did have a moon and yes, it was very similar to his, I felt a sort of awe (敬畏) at the possibilities that existed in his world. In Juan’s world, each village could have its own moon. In Juan’s world. the unknown and undiscovered was vast and marvelous. Anything was possible.In our society, we know that Earth has only one moon. We have looked at our planet from every angle and found all of the wildest things left to find. I can, from my computer at home, pull up satellite images of Juan’s village. There are no more continents and no more moons to search for, little left to discover. At least it seems that way.Yet, as I thought about Juan’s question, I was not sure how much more we could really rule out. I am, in part, an ant biologist, so my thoughts turned to what we know about insect life and I knew that much in the world of insects remains unknown. How much, though? How ignorant  (无知的) are we? The question of what we know and do not know constantly bothered me.I began collecting newspaper articles about new species, new monkey, new spider…, and on and on they appear. My drawer quickly filled. I began a second drawer for more general discoveries: new cave system discovered with dozens of nameless species, four hundred species of bacteria found in the human stomach. The second drawer began to fill and as it did I wondered whether there were bigger discoveries out there, not just species, but life that depends on things thought to be useless, life even without DNA. I started a third drawer for these big discoveries. It fills more slowly, but all the same, it fills.In looking into the stories of biological discovery, I also began to find something else, a collection of scientists, usually brilliant occasionally half-mad, who made the discoveries. Those scientists very often see the same things that other scientists see, but they pay more attention to them, and they focus on them to the point of exhaustion (穷尽), and at the risk of the ridicule of their peers. In looking for the stories of discovery, I found the stories of these people and how their lives changed our view of the world.We are repeatedly willing to imagine we have found most of what is left to discover. We used to think that insects were the smallest organisms (生物), and that nothing lived deeper than six hundred meters.

Wind is one of our cleanest and richest power sources（来源）, as well as one of the oldest. Evidence shows that windmills（风车）began to be used in ancient Iran back in the seventh century BC. They were first introduced to Europe during the 1100s, when armies returned from the Middle East with knowledge of using wind power.For many centuries, people used windmills to grind（磨碎）wheat into flour or pump water from deep underground when electricity was discovered in the late 1800s, people living in remote areas began to use them to produce electricity. This allowed them to have electric lights and radio. However, by the 1940s when electricity was available to people in almost all areas of the United States, windmills were rarely used.During the 1970s, people started becoming concerned about the pollution that is created when coal and gas are burned to produce electricity.

He came through several operations and a lot of pain by mastering his imagination.Tom loved to pretend, and he particularly loved to play superheroes. Dr. Epstein explained that it was actually a brilliant way for his young mind to handle the terrifying and painful life he led.The day before his third trip to the operating room, Tom was terribly afraid. “ Maybe I could go as Superman,” he whispered to his mom. Hearing this, the mother hesitated for while. She has avoided buying the expensive costume(戏装), but finally she agreed.The next day Tom appeared as the powerful Superman, showing off through the hospital halls and coolly waving his hand to the people greeting him along the way. And Tom, with the strength of his fantasy, successfully made it through the operation.The power of imagination need not be reserved for children only. We all have the power to use our fantasies to attempt things we never thought possible, to go through those things that seem impossible, and to achieve what we never believed we could. Just as Dr. Epstein puts it, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”It doesn’t mean that you should dress as a superhero for your next job interview.

I’m not going to say luck, talent, and circumstances don’t come into play because they do. Some people are born into the right family while others are born with great intelligence, and that’s just the reality of how life is.However, to succeed in life, one first needs to set a goal and then gradually make it more practical. And, in addition to that, in order to get really good at something, one needs to spend at least 10,000 hours studying and practicing. To become great at certain things, it’ll require even more time, time that most people won’t put in.This is a big reason why many successful people advise you to do something you love. If you don’t enjoy what you do, it is going to feel like unbearable pain and will likely make you quit well before you ever become good at it.When you see people exhibiting some great skills or having achieved great success, you know that they have put in a huge part of their life to get there at a huge cost. It’s sometimes easy to think they got lucky or they were born with some rare talent, but thinking that way does you no good, and there’s a huge chance that you’re wrong anyway.Whatever you do, if you want to become great at it, you need to work day in and day out, almost to the point of addiction, and over a long period of time.

{"passage": "Returning to a book you’ve read many times can feel like drinks with an old friend. There’s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don’t change, people do. And that’s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.The beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It’s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it’s all about the present. It’s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.There are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway’s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it’s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (令人陶醉的)，an aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (随笔) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar’s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.While I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them.

{"passage": "As Internet users become more dependent on the Internet to store information, are people remember less? If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how.In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood that the computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it.In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder (文件夹). Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location (位置) better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called \"transactive memory (交互记忆)\"According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date.

{"passage": "My father was 44 and knew he wasn’t going to make it to 45. He wrote me a letter and hoped that something in it would help me for the rest of my life.Since the day I was 12 and first read his letter, some of his words have lived in my heart. One part always stands out. “Right now, you are pretending to be a time-killer. But I know that one day, you will do something great that will set you among the very best.” Knowing that my dad believed in me gave me permission to believe in myself. “You will do something great.” He didn’t know what that would be, and neither did I, but at times in my life when I’ve felt proud of myself. I remember his words and wish he were here so I could ask. “Is this what you were talking about, Dad? Should I keep going?”A long way from 12 now, I realize he would have been proud when I made any progress. Lately, though, I’ve come to believe he’d want me to move on to what comes next: to be proud of,  and believe in, somebody else. It’s time to start writing my own letters to my children. Our children look to us with the same unanswered question we had. Our kids don’t hold back because they’re afraid to fail. They’re only afraid of failing us. They don’t worry about being disappointed. Their fear—as mine was until my father’s letter—is of being a disappointment.Give your children permission to succeed. They’re writing for you to believe in them. I always knew my parents loved me. But trust me.

{"passage": "As data and identity theft becomes more and more common, the market is growing for biometric（生物测量）technologies—like fingerprint scans—to keep others out of private e-spaces. At present, these technologies are still expensive, though.Researchers from Georgia Tech say that they have come up with a low-cost device（装置）that gets around this problem: a smart keyboard. This smart keyboard precisely measures the cadence（节奏）with which one types and the pressure fingers apply to each key. The keyboard could offer a strong layer of security by analyzing things like the force of a user's typing and the time between key presses. These patterns are unique to each person. Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to—regardless of whether someone gets the password right.It also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.In a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word “touch”four times using the smart keyboard.

{"passage": "I was in the middle of the Amazon (亚马逊) with my wife, who was there as a medical researcher. We flew on a small plane to a faraway village. We did not speak the local language, did not know the customs, and more often than not, did not entirely recognize the food. We could not have felt more foreign.We were raised on books and computers, highways and cell phones, but now we were living in a village without running water or electricity It was easy for us to go to sleep at the end of the day feeling a little misunderstood.Then one perfect Amazonian evening, with monkeys calling from beyond the village green, we played soccer. I am not good at soccer, but that evening it was wonderful. Everyone knew the rules. We all spoke the same language of passes and shots. We understood one another perfectly. As darkness came over the field and the match ended, the goal keeper, Juan, walked over to me and said in a matter-of-fact way, “In your home, do you have a moon too?” I was surprised.After I explained to Juan that yes, we did have a moon and yes, it was very similar to his, I felt a sort of awe (敬畏) at the possibilities that existed in his world. In Juan’s world, each village could have its own moon. In Juan’s world. the unknown and undiscovered was vast and marvelous. Anything was possible.In our society, we know that Earth has only one moon. We have looked at our planet from every angle and found all of the wildest things left to find. I can, from my computer at home, pull up satellite images of Juan’s village. There are no more continents and no more moons to search for, little left to discover. At least it seems that way.Yet, as I thought about Juan’s question, I was not sure how much more we could really rule out. I am, in part, an ant biologist, so my thoughts turned to what we know about insect life and I knew that much in the world of insects remains unknown. How much, though? How ignorant  (无知的) are we? The question of what we know and do not know constantly bothered me.I began collecting newspaper articles about new species, new monkey, new spider…, and on and on they appear. My drawer quickly filled. I began a second drawer for more general discoveries: new cave system discovered with dozens of nameless species, four hundred species of bacteria found in the human stomach. The second drawer began to fill and as it did I wondered whether there were bigger discoveries out there, not just species, but life that depends on things thought to be useless, life even without DNA. I started a third drawer for these big discoveries. It fills more slowly, but all the same, it fills.In looking into the stories of biological discovery, I also began to find something else, a collection of scientists, usually brilliant occasionally half-mad, who made the discoveries. Those scientists very often see the same things that other scientists see, but they pay more attention to them, and they focus on them to the point of exhaustion (穷尽), and at the risk of the ridicule of their peers. In looking for the stories of discovery, I found the stories of these people and how their lives changed our view of the world.We are repeatedly willing to imagine we have found most of what is left to discover. We used to think that insects were the smallest organisms (生物), and that nothing lived deeper than six hundred meters.

Today, they are once again a familiar sight, playing roles that are often just as important for the community as their original purpose.In rural areas, where ambulances can take a relatively long time to arrive, the phone boxes have taken on a lifesaving role. Local organizations can adopt them for l pound, and install defibrillators to help in emergencies.Others also looked at the phone boxes and saw business opportunities. LoveFone, a company that advocates repairing cellphones rather than abandoning them, opened a mini workshop in a London phone box in 2016.The tiny shops made economic sense, according to Robert Kerr, a founder of LoveFone. He said that one of the boxes generated around $13,500 in revenue a month and cost only about $400 to rent.Inglis said phone boxes called to mind an age when things were built to last.

Jonathan Socher and his wife Daphne started the kite factory in 1980. their kites are made of nylon（尼龙）.Their designs are Hawaiian themes created by Daphne. The designs are cut out of the nylon with a hot knife that seals the edges and then fastened directly onto the kite.  The kite that is used to give lessons is regular diamond kite with a rainbow pattern. The difference between this kite and the ones they make during the lessons is that it is a two-string controllable kite. Big Wind employees fly the kite and for a few minutes show students how pulling on one line and then on the other controls the direction the kite goes in. Then the controls are given to the students.Jonathan insists that it is not necessary to make a huge impressive kite to have fun making and flying kites.

{"passage": "El Nifio，a Spanish term for\"the Christ child\"，was named by South American fisherman who noticed that the global weather pattern，which happens every two to seven years，reduced the amount of fishes caught around Christmas．El Nifio sees warm water，collected over several years in the western Pacific，flow back eastwards when winds that normally blow westwards weaken，or sometimes the other way round．The weather effects both good and bad，are felt in many places．Rich countries gain more from powerful Nifio，on balance，than they lose．A study found that a strong Nifio in 1997 helped American's economy grow by 15 billion，partly because of better agricultural harvest，farmers in the Midwest gained from extra rain．The total rise in agricultural in rich countries in growth than the fall in poor ones．But in Indonesia extremely dry forests are in flames．A multi﹣year drought （干旱）in south﹣east Brazil is becoming worse．Though heavy rains brought about by El Nino may relieve the drought in California，they are likely to cause surface flooding and other disasters．The most recent powerful Nino，in 1997﹣98，killed around 21，000 people and caused damage worth $36 billion around the globe．But such Ninos come with months of warning，and so much is known about how they happen that governments can prepare．According to the Overseas Development Institute （ODI），however，just 12% of disaster﹣relief funding in the past two decades has gone on reducing risks in advance，rather than recovery and rebuilding afterwards．This is despite evidence that a dollar spent on risk﹣reduction saves at least two on reconstruction．Simple improvements to infrastructure （基础设施）can reduce the spread of disease．Better sewers （下水道）make it less likely that heavy rain is followed by an outbreak of the disease of bad stomach．Stronger bridges mean villages are less likely to be left without food and medicine after floods．According to a paper in 2011 by Mr Hsiang and co﹣authors，civil conflict is related to El Nino's harmful effects﹣and the poorer the country，the stronger the link．Though the relationship may not be causal，helping divided communities to prepare for disasters would at least reduce the risk that those disasters are followed by killing and wounding people．Since the poorest are least likely to make up for their losses from disasters linked to El Nino，reducing their losses needs to be the priority．", "question": "64．What is the author's purpose in writing the passage？", "options": ["(A)To introduce El Nino and its origin．", "(B)To explain the consequences of El Nino．", "(C)To show ways of fighting against El Nino．", "(D)To urge people to prepare for El Nino．"], "label": "D", "answer": null, "other": {"source": "2016年江苏省高考英语试卷"}}
