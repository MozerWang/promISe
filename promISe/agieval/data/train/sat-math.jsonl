Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \\%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \\%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \\%$. However, this is incorrect because $8 \\%$ of the tax is over the discounted price, not the original one. The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them. The expression in choice $C$ results from assigning $p$ to represent the original price of the laptop, rather than to the amount Alma paid to the cashier."}}
