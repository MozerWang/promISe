Moreover, this obsession compelled him to \"sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web.” These lines convey the extent to which Silas's behaviors were determined by his obsession.Choice B is incorrect because the narrator does not make it seem as if Silas's gold could reproduce on its own, with the first paragraph suggesting that his hoard was a consequence of hard work, his being \"deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web.\" Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because even if the first paragraph mentions that, after Eppie's arrival, Silas thinks about \"the ties and charities that bound together the families of his neighbors,\" the passage never addresses how Silas interacted with those neighbors previously.

The second sentence of the last paragraph says that the focus of Volkov's work was the role of electricity in the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism. The paragraph goes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant and \"altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.\" It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't describe Volkov's work as having involved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant's response to electricity. Choice $\\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers's earlier model, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is no suggestion that he made use of multiple \"published theories\" or \"earlier models\"; moreover, he made more extensive use of data generated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers's model."}}

In the last paragraph, she argues that women \"cannot remain inactive\" in confronting slavery as \"our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman. .. . Let our course, then, still be onward!\" Therefore, Smith's main purpose in the passage is to encourage women to see their participation in the abolitionist cause as just and important.Choices A and C are incorrect because Smith doesn't accuse fellow abolitionists of overlooking the contributions that women have made to the movement (choice (A)or make the case that women's rights are meaningless while slavery exists (choice C). Choice B is incorrect. Although Smith quotes the Declaration of Independence in the third paragraph, the main purpose of the passage isn't to argue that the causes of abolition and women's rights are continuations of the spirit of the American Revolution."}}

Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because although it is clear from the passage that Sempere was kind and even indulgent to the narrator, there is no suggestion that this treatment was inspired by respect for the narrator.

In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are \"imperial by virtue of their power\" and are therefore justified in being \"the propagandists ... of liberty.\" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, \"We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here\"; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States."}}

The first paragraph of Passage 1 quotes biochemist Kim Lewis of Northeastern University: \"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis.\" However, research conducted by Lewis has produced a drug called teixobactin, which has \"proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those that have developed immunity to other drugs,\" according to the second sentence of the second paragraph of Passage 1. Similarly, in the third sentence of the second paragraph of Passage 2, the author of the passage states that teixobactin \"killed the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world.\" Therefore, both passages make the point that teixobactin could be useful in combating infections that are no longer responding to treatment with other antibiotics.Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 1 outlines the methodology used to produce teixobactin but doesn't offer it as a model for future development of antibiotics produced in laboratory environments. Passage 2 suggests that future development of antibiotics may draw on the methodology that Lewis and others developed, but the passage doesn't go so far as to suggest that teixobactin could be used to standardize this development.

Dial determined that the position of their flapping wings facilitated the baby Chukars' traction on the steep ramps.Choices $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}$, and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the passage does not indicate that the Chukars' speed, alternation of wing and foot movement, or continual hopping motions facilitated their traction on steep ramps."}}

The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage.

Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?\" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole.

Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Theis and Adler's research was not able to explain how hand pollination rescued fruit weight, a finding the passage describes as \"a hard-to-interpret result\" (line 83).

Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch.

In the third paragraph, she wonders how women can \"have no interest\" in the subject of slavery when it could lead to the destruction of their families through war.
