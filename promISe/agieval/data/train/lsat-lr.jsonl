We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.", "question": "Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?", "options": ["(A)The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.", "(B)Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.", "(C)The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.", "(D)The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.", "(E)The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb."], "label": "D", "answer": null, "other": null}
{"passage": "Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups.

{"passage": "Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.

Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.", "question": "Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:", "options": ["(A)The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.", "(B)There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.", "(C)XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.", "(D)An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.", "(E)Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants."], "label": "D", "answer": null, "other": null}
{"passage": "Some scientists have expressed reservations about quantum theory because of its counterintuitive consequences.

{"passage": "Advertisement: Our oat bran cereal is the only one that has printed right on its package all of its claimed health benefits. And really health-conscious consumers have demonstrated that these health claims are true by buying our cereal since they would not have bought our cereal unless the claims were true.

The proof that these people really are polite is that they are consistently polite in their daily lives.", "(B)This card game must be intellectually challenging, because it is played by highly intelligent people, who play only intellectually challenging card games. In fact, these players' intelligence is demonstrated by the fact that they play this game.", "(C)When coffee is being chosen, Brand Z is the coffee chosen by people with highly developed taste in coffee. These people showed their highly developed taste in coffee by correctly distinguishing eight brands of coffee from each other in a taste test.", "(D)That jacket must have been made for a very short person, because only very short people were able to fit into it. We know that they were very short because we saw them before they tried on the jacket.", "(E)This painting is a poor imitation, because only people with poor eyesight mistook it for the original.

For one thing, this deterioration can be slowed by some anti-inflammatory drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer's are unable to eliminate the protein BA from the brain, where it accumulates and forms deposits. The microglia attack these protein deposits by releasing poisons that destroy surrounding healthy brain cells, thereby impairing the brain's cognitive functions.", "question": "Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the science writer's argument?", "options": ["(A)The inability of Alzheimer's patients to eliminate the protein BA from the brain is due to a deficiency in the brain's immune system.", "(B)Acetylsalicylic acid reduces the production of immune cells in the brain.", "(C)The activity of microglia results in a decrease in the buildup of protein deposits in the brain.", "(D)The protein BA directly interferes with the cognitive functions of the brain.", "(E)Immune reactions by microglia occur in certain diseases of the brain other than Alzheimer's."], "label": "B", "answer": null, "other": null}
