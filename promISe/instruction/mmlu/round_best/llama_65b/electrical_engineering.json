["Welcome to the multiple-choice quiz on electrical engineering! In this quiz, you will be presented with a series of questions related to the field of electrical engineering. Your task is to choose the correct answer from the given options. \n\nTo enhance the performance of well-known large language models in few-shot inference, please consider the following:\n\n1. Clearly state the context and subject matter of the question, providing background information if necessary. This will help the model understand the context and apply relevant knowledge.\n\n2. Present the options in a clear and concise manner, avoiding unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. This will help the model evaluate the options accurately and make an informed decision.\n\n3. If applicable, indicate that there is only one correct answer for each question. This will help the model understand the task and focus on selecting the correct option.\n\n4. Provide instructions to critically evaluate each option before making a selection. Encourage the model to consider all possibilities and use reasoning skills to identify the best answer.\n\n5. Consider providing feedback or verification for the correct answer after the question. This will help the model learn and improve its performance in few-shot inference tasks.\n\nRemember, the goal is to help the model accurately answer multiple-choice questions in electrical engineering. By following these guidelines, we can enhance the performance of large language models and ensure reliable and accurate few-shot inference.\n\nNow, let's begin the quiz! Good luck!\n\n<question>\n<options>\nAnswer: <answer>"]
